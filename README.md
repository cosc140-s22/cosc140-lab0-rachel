# COSC140 lab 0

## Lab feedback

 * How long did you spend on this lab?
I'm finishing the lab at 2:41pm, but I don't quite remember what time we started it in class. I only did questions 1 and 2, since I have a pretty bad headache right now, so I didn't really want to try the challenge problem.


 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?

Well, I found it difficult because of course I'm on Zoom and it's hard to get help/feedback from you and my peers. If I was in class, I think it would be much easier. However, I did find it a little frustrating, as I ended up just googling lots of things, but still don't feel as though I fully understand it. For instances, I'm still a bit confused on why I had to set position to absolute for the second problem, as I don't understand how that changed the 'button' from the whole line to just around the text.
